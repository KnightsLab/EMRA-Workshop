# Deep Learning Workshop: Hands-On Notebooks for 3D Medical Image Segmentation

Welcome to the hands-on portion of our Deep Learning workshop! This repository contains interactive notebooks that guide you through the process of building and training deep learning models for 3D medical image segmentation. The workshop is split into three parts, each with specific objectives to help you build a foundational and practical understanding of the tasks involved. 

Each part includes a link to an interactive Google Colab notebook, so you can follow along and run the code seamlessly in the cloud.

## **Part 1 of 3: Data Exploration**  
ðŸ“š **Objective:**  
- Introduce the Google Colab environment.  
- Explore the dataset for 3D medical image segmentation.  
- Understand input modalities and ground truth labels.  
- Use **SimpleITK** to inspect metadata, dimensions, spacing, and other characteristics of the 3D volumes.
